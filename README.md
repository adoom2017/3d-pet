# DesktopPet

DesktopPet is a lightweight 3D desktop pet for Windows and macOS. Phase 0 is in verification: the local Rust engineering baseline passes its gates, while dual-platform CI evidence is still pending. Windowing, rendering, and pet behavior work remain blocked.

## Prerequisites

- macOS or Windows
- Rust stable with Cargo, rustfmt, and Clippy
- Git

The repository includes `rust-toolchain.toml`, so rustup selects the expected stable toolchain and components automatically.

## Build and run

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo run -p desktop-pet
```

Phase 0 intentionally logs startup and exits cleanly. A persistent window is introduced only after Phase 0 passes its gates.

## Verification

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo build --workspace
```

The same commands run on macOS and Windows for every push and pull request.
